Directions to implement the project:

The 'final_code_for_windows' is intended to run on normal desktops with windows OS but LiDAr can't be integrated to it this code is just for demo to showcase it to people who may not have raspberry pi. 'final code' is intended to run on only on raspberry pi with linux OS with full functionality of camera and LiDAR. connect pi camera to raspberry pi's ribbon sci and LiDAR to rx and tx.

further modification will be done soon to interface it with push button using GPIO pins insted of keyboard interfacing.
